Sydney is a large city with among the highest Airbnb listings globally. These listings generate substantial quantities of data, which provide insights into the prevalence of listings across various suburbs, the prices of properties compared by location, size and time, and the prevalence of listings with selected features, such as being close to the shops. Additionally, customer experience can be measured through customer ratings. These factors can also be measured across each suburb, for each sized listing and across a time series.

To enable this data to be analysed and accessed, this project aims to develop software that can complete these tasks. This software will be able to report back data related to the location, price and cleanliness of a listing, and will be able to record the number of listings in each suburb.
