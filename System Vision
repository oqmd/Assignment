System Vision
Problem Background

Sydney’s Airbnb listings are so numerous that it is difficult to find any individual listing in the dataset. Software to categorise and refine a user’s results will greatly improve customer experience, as they will only see results that are relevant to them. They will be able to select a specific suburb, price range, features and cleanliness, then decide where they will stay from the results that remain.

System Overview

 

Potential Benefits

The software is being created to gain insights into Airbnb listings in Sydney through reporting information related to each listing, as well as an overview of all listings.

 

One potential benefit of the software is users being more aware of fair pricing of listings in their area, so they do not overpay for their accommodation. This will encourage hosts to price their listings more competitively, so that they receive guests.

 

Through this software, users will be able to compare listings with each other and will be able to make more informed decisions about their accommodation selection. They will be able to search for listings in the suburb they want, with added specifications, including the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and then choose a listing from the results that are returned.
